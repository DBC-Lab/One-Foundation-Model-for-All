# One-Foundation-Model-for-All

### Structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a vital tool for neuroimaging analyses, but the quality of MR images is often degraded by various factors, such as motion artifacts, large slice thickness, and imaging noise. These factors can cause confounding effects and pose significant challenges, especially in young children who tend to move during acquisition.

## Method
This manuscript describes a flexible and easy-to-implement method for significantly improving the quality of brain MR images through motion removal, super resolution, and denoising.
